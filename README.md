# Hi, I am Lucy ðŸ‘‹

I am a design oriented frontend developer. I am interested in building visual simple, revealing in action web applications with thoughtful code and user-friendly design. I would like to empower entrepreneurs and designers to create extraordinary online brands and bring clarity and vision to every project I work on. I have a gift for capture brands and businesses needs and translating it into visual layer for achieve commercial goals. I'm a *done is better than perfect* kind of person and that's why I decided to expose myself and my works for your thoughts.

Feel free to say ðŸ’¬  Hi to me!
